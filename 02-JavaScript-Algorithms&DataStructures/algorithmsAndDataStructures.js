/*Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions - 43% Complete

In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.
Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}

1.You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

2. Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.
Call the function. */

function reusableFunction() {
    console.log("Hi World");
  }

  reusableFunction();



/* Passing Values to Functions with Arguments - 44% Complete

Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.
Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:
function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
Then we can call testFun like this: testFun("Hello", "World");. We have passed two string arguments, Hello and World. Inside the function, param1 will equal the string Hello and param2 will equal the string World. Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.
Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
Call the function with two numbers as arguments. */
function functionWithArgs(argOne, argTwo) {
    console.log(argOne + argTwo);
  }
  
  functionWithArgs(1,2);
  functionWithArgs(7,9);



/* Return a Value from a Function with Return - 45% Complete

We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}

const answer = plusThree(5);
answer has the value 8.

plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

1. Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value.
*/
function timesFive (arg) {
    return arg * 5;
  }
  
  timesFive(5);
  timesFive(2);
  timesFive(0);



/* Global Scope and Functions - 46% Complete

In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

1. Using let or const, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

2. Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var, let or const keywords. */
// Declare the myGlobal variable below this line
let myGlobal = 10;
oopsGlobal;

function fun1() {
  oopsGlobal = 5;// Assign 5 to oopsGlobal here
}

// Only change code above this line

function fun2() {
  let output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }
  if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
  }
  console.log(output);
}



/* Local Scope and Functions - 47% Complete

Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail. */
function myLocalScope() {
    // Only change code below this line
    let myVar;
    console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
  }
  
  myLocalScope();
  // Run and check the console
  // myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
  console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);



/* Global vs. Local Scope in Functions - 48% Complete
  It is possible to have both local and global variables with the same name. When you do this, the local variable takes precedence over the global variable.
  
  In this example:
  
  const someVar = "Hat";
  
  function myFun() {
    const someVar = "Head";
    return someVar;
  }
  The function myFun will return the string Head because the local version of the variable is present.
  
  Add a local variable to myOutfit function to override the value of outerWear with the string sweater. */
  // Setup
const outerWear = "T-Shirt";

function myOutfit() {
  // Only change code below this line
  const outerWear = "sweater";
  // Only change code above this line
  return outerWear;
}

myOutfit();



/* Understanding Undefined Value returned from a Function - 49% Complete

A function can include the return statement but it does not have to. In the case that the function doesn't have a return statement, when you call it, the function processes the inner code but the returned value is undefined.

Example

let sum = 0;

function addSum(num) {
  sum = sum + num;
}

addSum(3);
addSum is a function without a return statement. The function will change the global sum variable but the returned value of the function is undefined.

Create a function addFive without any arguments. This function adds 5 to the sum variable, but its returned value is undefined. */
// Setup
let sum = 0;

function addThree() {
  sum = sum + 3;
}

// Only change code below this line
function addFive() {
  sum += 5;
}

// Only change code above this line

addThree();
addFive();



/* Assignment with a Returned Value - 50% Complete
If you'll recall from our discussion about Storing Values with the Assignment Operator, everything to the right of the equal sign is resolved before the value is assigned. This means we can take the return value of a function and assign it to a variable.

Assume we have defined a function sum which adds two numbers together.

ourSum = sum(5, 12);
Calling the sum function with the arguments of 5 and 12 produces a return value of 17. This return value is assigned to the ourSum variable.

Call the processArg function with an argument of 7 and assign its return value to the variable processed.

 */

// Setup
let processed = 0;

function processArg(num) {
  return (num + 3) / 5;
}

// Only change code below this line
processed = processArg(7);



/* Stand in Line - 50% Complete

Write a function nextInLine which takes an array (arr) and a number (item) as arguments.

Add the number to the end of the array, then remove the first element of the array.

The nextInLine function should then return the element that was removed. */
function nextInLine(arr, item) {
    // Only change code below this line
    let queue = arr.push(item);
    let removeItem = arr.shift()

  /* Understanding Boolean Values - 51% Complete
Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: true or false. They are basically little on-off switches, where true is on and false is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.

Note: Boolean values are never written with quotes. The strings "true" and "false" are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

Modify the welcomeToBooleans function so that it returns true instead of false. */
function welcomeToBooleans() {
    // Only change code below this line
  
    return true; // Change this line
  
    // Only change code above this line
  }



/* Use Conditional Logic with If Statements - 52% Complete
if statements are used to make decisions in code. The keyword if tells JavaScript to execute the code in the curly braces under certain conditions, defined in the parentheses. These conditions are known as Boolean conditions and they may only be true or false.

When the condition evaluates to true, the program executes the statement inside the curly braces. When the Boolean condition evaluates to false, the statement inside the curly braces will not execute.

Pseudocode

if (condition is true) {
  statement is executed
}
Example

function test (myCondition) {
  if (myCondition) {
    return "It was true";
  }
  return "It was false";
}

test(true);
test(false);
test(true) returns the string It was true, and test(false) returns the string It was false.

When test is called with a value of true, the if statement evaluates myCondition to see if it is true or not. Since it is true, the function returns It was true. When we call test with a value of false, myCondition is not true and the statement in the curly braces is not executed and the function returns It was false.

Create an if statement inside the function to return Yes, that was true if the parameter wasThatTrue is true and return No, that was false otherwise. */
function trueOrFalse(wasThatTrue) {
    // Only change code below this line
    if (wasThatTrue == true) {
      return 'Yes, that was true';
    } else {
      return 'No, that was false';
    }
  
  
    // Only change code above this line
  
  }



/* Comparison with the Equality Operator - 53% Complete
There are many comparison operators in JavaScript. All of these operators return a boolean true or false value.

The most basic operator is the equality operator ==. The equality operator compares two values and returns true if they're equivalent or false if they are not. Note that equality is different from assignment (=), which assigns the value on the right of the operator to a variable on the left.

function equalityTest(myVal) {
  if (myVal == 10) {
    return "Equal";
  }
  return "Not Equal";
}
If myVal is equal to 10, the equality operator returns true, so the code in the curly braces will execute, and the function will return Equal. Otherwise, the function will return Not Equal. In order for JavaScript to compare two different data types (for example, numbers and strings), it must convert one type to another. This is known as Type Coercion. Once it does, however, it can compare terms as follows:

1   ==  1  // true
1   ==  2  // false
1   == '1' // true
"3" ==  3  // true
Add the equality operator to the indicated line so that the function will return the string Equal when val is equivalent to 12. */
// Setup
function testEqual(val) {
    if (val == 12) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  
  testEqual(10);



/* Comparison with the Strict Equality Operator - 54% Complete
Strict equality (===) is the counterpart to the equality operator (==). However, unlike the equality operator, which attempts to convert both values being compared to a common type, the strict equality operator does not perform a type conversion.

If the values being compared have different types, they are considered unequal, and the strict equality operator will return false.

Examples

3 ===  3  // true
3 === '3' // false
In the second example, 3 is a Number type and '3' is a String type.

Use the strict equality operator in the if statement so the function will return the string Equal when val is strictly equal to 7. */
// Setup
function testStrict(val) {
    if (val === 7) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  
  testStrict(10);



  /* Practice comparing different values - 55% Complete
In the last two challenges, we learned about the equality operator (==) and the strict equality operator (===). Let's do a quick review and practice using these operators some more.

If the values being compared are not of the same type, the equality operator will perform a type conversion, and then evaluate the values. However, the strict equality operator will compare both the data type and value as-is, without converting one type to the other.

Examples

3 == '3' returns true because JavaScript performs type conversion from string to number. 3 === '3' returns false because the types are different and type conversion is not performed.

Note: In JavaScript, you can determine the type of a variable or a value with the typeof operator, as follows:

typeof 3
typeof '3'
typeof 3 returns the string number, and typeof '3' returns the string string.

The compareEquality function in the editor compares two values using the equality operator. Modify the function so that it returns the string Equal only when the values are strictly equal. */

// Setup
function compareEquality(a, b) {
    if (a === b) { // Change this line
      return "Equal";
    }
    return "Not Equal";
  }
  
  compareEquality(10, "10");



/* Comparison with the Inequality Operator - 56% Complete
The inequality operator (!=) is the opposite of the equality operator. It means not equal and returns false where equality would return true and vice versa. Like the equality operator, the inequality operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

1 !=  2    // true
1 != "1"   // false
1 != '1'   // false
1 != true  // false
0 != false // false
Add the inequality operator != in the if statement so that the function will return the string Not Equal when val is not equivalent to 99. */

// Setup
function testNotEqual(val) {
    if (val != 99) { // Change this line
      return "Not Equal";
    }
    return "Equal";
  }
  
  testNotEqual(10);



  /* Comparison with the Strict Inequality Operator - 57% Complete
The strict inequality operator (!==) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It means "Strictly Not Equal" and returns false where strict equality would return true and vice versa. The strict inequality operator will not convert data types.

Examples

3 !==  3  // false
3 !== '3' // true
4 !==  3  // true
Add the strict inequality operator to the if statement so the function will return the string Not Equal when val is not strictly equal to 17 */

// Setup
function testStrictNotEqual(val) {
    if (val !== 17) { // Change this line
      return "Not Equal";
    }
    return "Equal";
  }
  
  testStrictNotEqual(10);



  /* Comparison with the Greater Than Operator - 58% Complete
The greater than operator (>) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than operator will convert data types of values while comparing.

Examples

5   >  3  // true
7   > '3' // true
2   >  3  // false
'1' >  9  // false
Add the greater than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense. */

function testGreaterThan(val) {
    if (val > 100) {  // Change this line
      return "Over 100";

    return "10 or Under";
  }

  /* Comparison with the Greater Than Or Equal To Operator - 58% Complete
The greater than or equal to operator (>=) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is greater than or equal to the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Like the equality operator, the greater than or equal to operator will convert data types while comparing.

Examples

6   >=  6  // true
7   >= '3' // true
2   >=  3  // false
'7' >=  9  // false
Add the greater than or equal to operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense. */

  /* Comparison with the Less Than Operator - 59% Complete
The less than operator (<) compares the values of two numbers. If the number to the left is less than the number to the right, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than operator converts data types while comparing.

Examples

2   < 5 // true
'3' < 7 // true
5   < 5 // false
3   < 2 // false
'8' < 4 // false
Add the less than operator to the indicated lines so that the return statements make sense. */

If the number on the left is greater than the number on the right, it returns false. Like the equality operator, the less than or equal to operator converts data types.

Examples

4   <= 5 // true
'7' <= 7 // true

  /* Comparisons with the Logical And Operator - 61% Complete

Sometimes you will need to test more than one thing at a time. The logical and operator (&&) returns true if and only if the operands to the left and right of it are true.

The same effect could be achieved by nesting an if statement inside another if:

if (num > 5) {
  if (num < 10) {
    return "Yes";
  }
}
return "No";
will only return Yes if num is greater than 5 and less than 10. The same logic can be written as:

if (num > 5 && num < 10) {
  return "Yes";
}
return "No";
Replace the two if statements with one statement, using the && operator, which will return the string Yes if val is less than or equal to 50 and greater than or equal to 25. Otherwise, will return the string No. */
function testLogicalAnd(val) {
    // Only change code below this line

  /* Comparisons with the Logical Or Operator - 62% Complete
The logical or operator (||) returns true if either of the operands is true. Otherwise, it returns false.

The logical or operator is composed of two pipe symbols: (||). This can typically be found between your Backspace and Enter keys.

The pattern below should look familiar from prior waypoints:

if (num > 10) {
  return "No";
}
if (num < 5) {
  return "No";
}

if (num > 10 || num < 5) {
  return "No";
}
return "Yes";

  /* Logical Order in If Else Statements - 65% Complete
Order is important in if, else if statements.

The function is executed from top to bottom so you will want to be careful of what statement comes first.

Take these two functions as an example.

Here's the first:

function foo(x) {
  if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
And the second just switches the order of the statements:

function bar(x) {
  if (x < 2) {
    return "Less than two";
  } else if (x < 1) {
    return "Less than one";
  } else {
    return "Greater than or equal to two";
  }
}
While these two functions look nearly identical if we pass a number to both we get different outputs.

foo(0)
bar(0)
foo(0) will return the string Less than one, and bar(0) will return the string Less than two.

Change the order of logic in the function so that it will return the correct statements in all cases. */

/* Adding a Default Option in Switch Statements - 68% Complete

In a switch statement you may not be able to specify all possible values as case statements. Instead, you can add the default statement which will be executed if no matching case statements are found. Think of it like the final else statement in an if/else chain.

A default statement should be the last case.

switch (num) {
  case value1:
    statement1;
    break;

/* Returning Boolean Values from Functions - 71% Complete

You may recall from Comparison with the Equality Operator that all comparison operators return a boolean true or false value.

Sometimes people use an if/else statement to do a comparison, like this:

function isEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
But there's a better way to do this. Since === returns true or false, we can return the result of the comparison:

function isEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b;
}

/* Return Early Pattern for Functions - 72% Complete

When a return statement is reached, the execution of the current function stops and control returns to the calling location.

Example

function myFun() {

}
myFun();
The above will display the string Hello in the console, and return the string World. The string byebye will never display in the console, because the function exits at the return statement.

/* Counting Cards - 73% Complete
In the casino game Blackjack, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

Count Change	Cards
+1	2, 3, 4, 5, 6
0	7, 8, 9
-1	10, 'J', 'Q', 'K', 'A'
You will write a card counting function. It will receive a card parameter, which can be a number or a string, and increment or decrement the global count variable according to the card's value (see table). The function will then return a string with the current count and the string Bet if the count is positive, or Hold if the count is zero or negative. The current count and the player's decision (Bet or Hold) should be separated by a single space.

Example Outputs: -3 Hold or 5 Bet

Hint
Do NOT reset count to 0 when value is 7, 8, or 9.
Do NOT return an array.
Do NOT include quotes (single or double) in the output. */

/* Build JavaScript Objects - 73% Complete
You may have heard the term object before.

Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represent real world objects, like a cat.

Here's a sample cat object:

const cat = {
  "name": "Whiskers",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "enemies": ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
In this example, all the properties are stored as strings, such as name, legs, and tails. However, you can also use numbers as properties. You can even omit the quotes for single-word string properties, as follows:

const anotherObject = {
  make: "Ford",
  5: "five",
  "model": "focus"
};
However, if your object has any non-string properties, JavaScript will automatically typecast them as strings.

Make an object that represents a dog called myDog which contains the properties name (a string), legs, tails and friends.

You can set these object properties to whatever values you want, as long as name is a string, legs and tails are numbers, and friends is an array. */

const myDog = {
  // Only change code below this line
  "name": "Titanium",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["lassie","soccerdog","scoobydoo"]
  // Only change code above this line
};



/* Accessing Object Properties with Dot Notation - 74% Complete
There are two ways to access the properties of an object: dot notation (.) and bracket notation ([]), similar to an array.

Dot notation is what you use when you know the name of the property you're trying to access ahead of time.

Here is a sample of using dot notation (.) to read an object's property:

const myObj = {
  prop1: "val1",
  prop2: "val2"
};

const prop1val = myObj.prop1;
const prop2val = myObj.prop2;
prop1val would have a value of the string val1, and prop2val would have a value of the string val2.

Read in the property values of testObj using dot notation. Set the variable hatValue equal to the object's property hat and set the variable shirtValue equal to the object's property shirt. */

// Setup
const testObj = {
  "hat": "ballcap",
  "shirt": "jersey",
  "shoes": "cleats" 
};

// Only change code below this line
const hatValue = testObj.hat;      // Change this line
const shirtValue = testObj.shirt;    // Change this line



/* Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation - 75% Complete
The second way to access the properties of an object is bracket notation ([]). If the property of the object you are trying to access has a space in its name, you will need to use bracket notation.

However, you can still use bracket notation on object properties without spaces.

Here is a sample of using bracket notation to read an object's property:

const myObj = {
  "Space Name": "Kirk",
  "More Space": "Spock",
  "NoSpace": "USS Enterprise"
};

myObj["Space Name"];
myObj['More Space'];
myObj["NoSpace"];
myObj["Space Name"] would be the string Kirk, myObj['More Space'] would be the string Spock, and myObj["NoSpace"] would be the string USS Enterprise.

Note that property names with spaces in them must be in quotes (single or double).

Read the values of the properties an entree and the drink of testObj using bracket notation and assign them to entreeValue and drinkValue respectively. */

// Setup
const testObjTwo = {
  "an entree": "hamburger",
  "my side": "veggies",
  "the drink": "water"
};

// Only change code below this line
const entreeValue = testObjTwo["an entree"];   // Change this line
const drinkValue = testObjTwo["the drink"];    // Change this line



/* Accessing Object Properties with Variables - 76% Complete
Another use of bracket notation on objects is to access a property which is stored as the value of a variable. This can be very useful for iterating through an object's properties or when accessing a lookup table.

Here is an example of using a variable to access a property:

const dogs = {
  Fido: "Mutt",
  Hunter: "Doberman",
  Snoopie: "Beagle"
};

const myDog = "Hunter";
const myBreed = dogs[myDog];
console.log(myBreed);
The string Doberman would be displayed in the console.

Note that we do not use quotes around the variable name when using it to access the property because we are using the value of the variable, not the name.

Set the playerNumber variable to 16. Then, use the variable to look up the player's name and assign it to player. */

// Setup
const testObjThree = {
  12: "Namath",
  16: "Montana",
  19: "Unitas"
};

// Only change code below this line
const playerNumber = 16;  // Change this line
const player = testObjThree[playerNumber];   // Change this line



/* Updating Object Properties - 77% Complete
After you've created a JavaScript object, you can update its properties at any time just like you would update any other variable. You can use either dot or bracket notation to update.

For example, let's look at ourDog:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};
Since he's a particularly happy dog, let's change his name to the string Happy Camper. Here's how we update his object's name property: ourDog.name = "Happy Camper"; or ourDog["name"] = "Happy Camper"; Now when we evaluate ourDog.name, instead of getting Camper, we'll get his new name, Happy Camper.

Update the myDog object's name property. Let's change her name from Coder to Happy Coder. You can use either dot or bracket notation. */

// Setup
const myDogTwo = {
  "name": "Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

// Only change code below this line
myDogTwo.name = "Happy Coder";



/* Add New Properties to a JavaScript Object - 78% Complete
You can add new properties to existing JavaScript objects the same way you would modify them.

Here's how we would add a bark property to ourDog:

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
or

ourDog["bark"] = "bow-wow";
Now when we evaluate ourDog.bark, we'll get his bark, bow-wow.

Example:

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

ourDog.bark = "bow-wow";
Add a bark property to myDog and set it to a dog sound, such as "woof". You may use either dot or bracket notation. */

const myDogThree = {
  "name": "Happy Coder",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"]
};

myDogThree.bark = "woof";



/* Delete Properties from a JavaScript Object - 79% COMPLETE
We can also delete properties from objects like this:

delete ourDog.bark;

const ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"],
  "bark": "bow-wow"
};

delete ourDog.bark;
After the last line shown above, ourDog looks like:

{
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
}
Delete the tails property from myDog. You may use either dot or bracket notation. */

  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["freeCodeCamp Campers"],
  "bark": "woof"
};

// Only change code below this line
delete myDogFour.tails;



/* Using Objects for Lookups - 80% COMPLETE
Objects can be thought of as a key/value storage, like a dictionary. If you have tabular data, you can use an object to lookup values rather than a switch statement or an if/else chain. This is most useful when you know that your input data is limited to a certain range.

Here is an example of an article object:

const article = {
  "title": "How to create objects in JavaScript",
  "link": "https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-guide-to-creating-objects-in-javascript-b0e2450655e8/",
  "author": "Kaashan Hussain",
  "language": "JavaScript",
  "tags": "TECHNOLOGY",
  "createdAt": "NOVEMBER 28, 2018"
};

const articleAuthor = article["author"];
const articleLink = article["link"];

const value = "title";
const valueLookup = article[value];
articleAuthor is the string Kaashan Hussain, articleLink is the string https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-complete-guide-to-creating-objects-in-javascript-b0e2450655e8/, and valueLookup is the string How to create objects in JavaScript.

Convert the switch statement into an object called lookup. Use it to look up val and assign the associated string to the result variable. */

// Setup
function phoneticLookup(val) {
  let result = "";

  // Only change code below this line
  
  const lookup = {
    "alpha": "Adams",
    "bravo": "Boston",
    "charlie": "Chicago",

    "foxtrot": "Frank"
  };

  result = lookup[val];

  // Only change code above this line
  return result;
}

phoneticLookup("charlie");



/* Testing Objects for Properties - 81% COMPLETE
Sometimes it is useful to check if the property of a given object exists or not. We can use the .hasOwnProperty(propname) method of objects to determine if that object has the given property name. .hasOwnProperty() returns true or false if the property is found or not.

Example

const myObj = {
  top: "hat",
  bottom: "pants"
};

myObj.hasOwnProperty("top");
myObj.hasOwnProperty("middle");
The first hasOwnProperty returns true, while the second returns false.

Modify the function checkObj to test if an object passed to the function (obj) contains a specific property (checkProp). If the property is found, return that property's value. If not, return "Not Found". */

function checkObj(obj, checkProp) {
  // Only change code below this line
  if (obj.hasOwnProperty(checkProp)) {
    return obj[checkProp];
  } else {
    return "Not Found";
  }
  // Only change code above this line
}



/* Manipulating Complex Objects - 81% COMPLETE
Sometimes you may want to store data in a flexible Data Structure. A JavaScript object is one way to handle flexible data. They allow for arbitrary combinations of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, functions, and objects.

Here's an example of a complex data structure:

const ourMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Homework",
    "release_year": 1997,
    "formats": [ 
      "CD", 
      "Cassette", 
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];
This is an array which contains one object inside. The object has various pieces of metadata about an album. It also has a nested formats array. If you want to add more album records, you can do this by adding records to the top level array. Objects hold data in a property, which has a key-value format. In the example above, "artist": "Daft Punk" is a property that has a key of artist and a value of Daft Punk.

Note: You will need to place a comma after every object in the array, unless it is the last object in the array.

Add a new album to the myMusic array. Add artist and title strings, release_year number, and a formats array of strings. */

const myMusic = [
  {
    "artist": "Billy Joel",
    "title": "Piano Man",
    "release_year": 1973,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "8T",
      "LP"
    ],
    "gold": true
  },
  {
    "artist": "Daft Punk",
    "title": "Discovery",
    "release_year": 2001,
    "formats": [
      "CD",
      "8T",
      "LP",
      "MP3"
    ],
    "gold": true
  }
];



/* Accessing Nested Objects - 82% COMPLETE
The sub-properties of objects can be accessed by chaining together the dot or bracket notation.

Here is a nested object:

const ourStorage = {
  "desk": {
    "drawer": "stapler"
  },
  "cabinet": {
    "top drawer": { 
      "folder1": "a file",
      "folder2": "secrets"
    },
    "bottom drawer": "soda"
  }
};

ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2;
ourStorage.desk.drawer;
ourStorage.cabinet["top drawer"].folder2 would be the string secrets, and ourStorage.desk.drawer would be the string stapler.

Access the myStorage object and assign the contents of the glove box property to the gloveBoxContents variable. Use dot notation for all properties where possible, otherwise use bracket notation. */

const myStorage = {
  "car": {
    "inside": {
      "glove box": "maps",
      "passenger seat": "crumbs"
     },
    "outside": {
      "trunk": "jack"
    }
  }
};

const gloveBoxContents = myStorage.car.inside["glove box"];



/* Accessing Nested Arrays - 83% COMPLETE
As we have seen in earlier examples, objects can contain both nested objects and nested arrays. Similar to accessing nested objects, array bracket notation can be chained to access nested arrays.

Here is an example of how to access a nested array:

const ourPets = [
  {
    animalType: "cat",
    names: [
      "Meowzer",
      "Fluffy",
      "Kit-Cat"
    ]
  },
  {
    animalType: "dog",
    names: [
      "Spot",
      "Bowser",
      "Frankie"
    ]
  }
];

ourPets[0].names[1];
ourPets[1].names[0];
ourPets[0].names[1] would be the string Fluffy, and ourPets[1].names[0] would be the string Spot.

Using dot and bracket notation, set the variable secondTree to the second item in the trees list from the myPlants object. */

const myPlants = [
  {
    type: "flowers",
    list: [
      "rose",
      "tulip",
      "dandelion"
    ]
  },
  {
    type: "trees",
    list: [
      "fir",
      "pine",
      "birch"
    ]
  }
];

const secondTree = myPlants[1].list[1];



/* Record Collection - 84% COMPLETE
You are given an object literal representing a part of your musical album collection. Each album has a unique id number as its key and several other properties. Not all albums have complete information.

You start with an updateRecords function that takes an object literal, records, containing the musical album collection, an id, a prop (like artist or tracks), and a value. Complete the function using the rules below to modify the object passed to the function.

Your function must always return the entire record collection object.
If prop isn't tracks and value isn't an empty string, update or set that album's prop to value.
If prop is tracks but the album doesn't have a tracks property, create an empty array and add value to it.
If prop is tracks and value isn't an empty string, add value to the end of the album's existing tracks array.
If value is an empty string, delete the given prop property from the album.
Note: A copy of the recordCollection object is used for the tests. */

// Setup
const recordCollection = {
  2548: {
    albumTitle: 'Slippery When Wet',
    artist: 'Bon Jovi',
    tracks: ['Let It Rock', 'You Give Love a Bad Name']
  },

/* Iterate with JavaScript While Loops - 85% COMPLETE
You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The first type of loop we will learn is called a while loop because it runs while a specified condition is true and stops once that condition is no longer true.

const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
In the code example above, the while loop will execute 5 times and append the numbers 0 through 4 to ourArray.

Let's try getting a while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Add the numbers 5 through 0 (inclusive) in descending order to myArray using a while loop. */

// Setup
const myArrayTwo = [];

// Only change code below this line
let i = 5;

while (i >= 0) {
  myArrayTwo.push(i);
  i--;
}



/* Iterate with JavaScript For Loops - 87% COMPLETE

You can run the same code multiple times by using a loop.

The most common type of JavaScript loop is called a for loop because it runs for a specific number of times.

For loops are declared with three optional expressions separated by semicolons:

for (a; b; c), where a is the initialization statement, b is the condition statement, and c is the final expression.

The initialization statement is executed one time only before the loop starts. It is typically used to define and setup your loop variable.

The condition statement is evaluated at the beginning of every loop iteration and will continue as long as it evaluates to true. When the condition is false at the start of the iteration, the loop will stop executing. This means if the condition starts as false, your loop will never execute.

The final expression is executed at the end of each loop iteration, prior to the next condition check and is usually used to increment or decrement your loop counter.

In the following example we initialize with i = 0 and iterate while our condition i < 5 is true. We'll increment i by 1 in each loop iteration with i++ as our final expression.

const ourArray = [];

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  ourArray.push(i);

/*  Iterate Through an Array with a For Loop - 88% COMPLETE

A common task in JavaScript is to iterate through the contents of an array. One way to do that is with a for loop. This code will output each element of the array arr to the console:

const arr = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
   console.log(arr[i]);
}
Remember that arrays have zero-based indexing, which means the last index of the array is length - 1. Our condition for this loop is i < arr.length, which stops the loop when i is equal to length. In this case the last iteration is i === 4 i.e. when i becomes equal to arr.length - 1 and outputs 6 to the console. Then i increases to 5, and the loop terminates because i < arr.length is false.

Declare and initialize a variable total to 0. Use a for loop to add the value of each element of the myArr array to total. */

// Setup
const myArr = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

// Only change code below this line
let total = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < myArr.length; i++) {
  total += (myArr[i]);
}

console.log(total);



/* Nesting For Loops - 89% COMPLETE

If you have a multi-dimensional array, you can use the same logic as the prior waypoint to loop through both the array and any sub-arrays. Here is an example:

const arr = [
  [1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]
];

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
    console.log(arr[i][j]);
  }
}
This outputs each sub-element in arr one at a time. Note that for the inner loop, we are checking the .length of arr[i], since arr[i] is itself an array.

      product = product * arr[i][j];
    }
  }
  // Only change code above this line
  
  return product;
}

multiplyAll([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]]);



/* Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops - 90% COMPLETE

The next type of loop you will learn is called a do...while loop. It is called a do...while loop because it will first do one pass of the code inside the loop no matter what, and then continue to run the loop while the specified condition evaluates to true.

const ourArray = [];
let i = 0;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
The example above behaves similar to other types of loops, and the resulting array will look like [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]. However, what makes the do...while different from other loops is how it behaves when the condition fails on the first check. Let's see this in action. Here is a regular while loop that will run the code in the loop as long as i < 5:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

while (i < 5) {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
}
In this example, we initialize the value of ourArray to an empty array and the value of i to 5. When we execute the while loop, the condition evaluates to false because i is not less than 5, so we do not execute the code inside the loop. The result is that ourArray will end up with no values added to it, and it will still look like [] when all of the code in the example above has completed running. Now, take a look at a do...while loop:

const ourArray = []; 
let i = 5;

do {
  ourArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
In this case, we initialize the value of i to 5, just like we did with the while loop. When we get to the next line, there is no condition to evaluate, so we go to the code inside the curly braces and execute it. We will add a single element to the array and then increment i before we get to the condition check. When we finally evaluate the condition i < 5 on the last line, we see that i is now 6, which fails the conditional check, so we exit the loop and are done. At the end of the above example, the value of ourArray is [5]. Essentially, a do...while loop ensures that the code inside the loop will run at least once. Let's try getting a do...while loop to work by pushing values to an array.

Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running. */

// Setup
const myArraySix = [];
let ij = 10;

// Only change code below this line
do {
  myArray.push(i);
  ij++;
} while (ij < 5)



/* Replace Loops using Recursion - 91% COMPLETE

Recursion is the concept that a function can be expressed in terms of itself. To help understand this, start by thinking about the following task: multiply the first n elements of an array to create the product of those elements. Using a for loop, you could do this:

  function multiply(arr, n) {
    let product = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      product *= arr[i];
    }
    return product;
  }
However, notice that multiply(arr, n) == multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1]. That means you can rewrite multiply in terms of itself and never need to use a loop.

  function multiply(arr, n) {
    if (n <= 0) {
      return 1;
    } else {
      return multiply(arr, n - 1) * arr[n - 1];
    }
  }
The recursive version of multiply breaks down like this. In the base case, where n <= 0, it returns 1. For larger values of n, it calls itself, but with n - 1. That function call is evaluated in the same way, calling multiply again until n <= 0. At this point, all the functions can return and the original multiply returns the answer.

Note: Recursive functions must have a base case when they return without calling the function again (in this example, when n <= 0), otherwise they can never finish executing.

Write a recursive function, sum(arr, n), that returns the sum of the first n elements of an array arr. */

function sum(arr, n) {
  // Only change code below this line
 if(n <= 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return sum(arr, n - 1) + arr[n - 1];
  }

}

/* Generate Random Fractions with JavaScript - 93% COMPLETE

/* Generate Random Whole Numbers with JavaScript - 94% COMPLETE

It's great that we can generate random decimal numbers, but it's even more useful if we use it to generate random whole numbers.

Use Math.random() to generate a random decimal.
Multiply that random decimal by 20.
Use another function, Math.floor() to round the number down to its nearest whole number.
Remember that Math.random() can never quite return a 1 and, because we're rounding down, it's impossible to actually get 20. This technique will give us a whole number between 0 and 19.

Putting everything together, this is what our code looks like:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 20);
We are calling Math.random(), multiplying the result by 20, then passing the value to Math.floor() function to round the value down to the nearest whole number.

Use this technique to generate and return a random whole number between 0 and 9. */

/* Generate Random Whole Numbers within a Range - 95% COMPLETE

The function call looks like:

parseInt(string, radix);
And here's an example:

const a = parseInt("11", 2);

function convertToInteger(str) {
  return parseInt(str, 2);
}

/* Use the Conditional (Ternary) Operator - 97% COMPLETE

The conditional operator, also called the ternary operator, can be used as a one line if-else expression.

The syntax is a ? b : c, where a is the condition, b is the code to run when the condition returns true, and c is the code to run when the condition returns false.

The following function uses an if/else statement to check a condition:

function findGreater(a, b) {
  if(a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater or equal";
  }
}
This can be re-written using the conditional operator:

function findGreater(a, b) {
  return a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater or equal";
}
Use the conditional operator in the checkEqual function to check if two numbers are equal or not. The function should return either the string Equal or the string Not Equal. */

function checkEqual(a, b) {
  return a === b ? "Equal" : "Not Equal";
}

checkEqual(1, 2);



/* Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators - 98% COMPLETE

In the previous challenge, you used a single conditional operator. You can also chain them together to check for multiple conditions.

The following function uses if, else if, and else statements to check multiple conditions:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  if (a === b) {
    return "a and b are equal";
  }
  else if (a > b) {
    return "a is greater";
  }
  else {
    return "b is greater";
  }
}
The above function can be re-written using multiple conditional operators:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" 
    : (a > b) ? "a is greater" 
    : "b is greater";
}
It is considered best practice to format multiple conditional operators such that each condition is on a separate line, as shown above. Using multiple conditional operators without proper indentation may make your code hard to read. For example:

function findGreaterOrEqual(a, b) {
  return (a === b) ? "a and b are equal" : (a > b) ? "a is greater" : "b is greater";
}
In the checkSign function, use multiple conditional operators - following the recommended format used in findGreaterOrEqual - to check if a number is positive, negative or zero. The function should return positive, negative or zero. */

function checkSign(num) {
  return (num === 0) ? "zero": (num > 0) ? "positive": "negative";
}

checkSign(10);



/* Use Recursion to Create a Countdown - 99% COMPLETE

In a previous challenge, you learned how to use recursion to replace a for loop. Now, let's look at a more complex function that returns an array of consecutive integers starting with 1 through the number passed to the function.

As mentioned in the previous challenge, there will be a base case. The base case tells the recursive function when it no longer needs to call itself. It is a simple case where the return value is already known. There will also be a recursive call which executes the original function with different arguments. If the function is written correctly, eventually the base case will be reached.

For example, say you want to write a recursive function that returns an array containing the numbers 1 through n. This function will need to accept an argument, n, representing the final number. Then it will need to call itself with progressively smaller values of n until it reaches 1. You could write the function as follows:

function countup(n) {
  if (n < 1) {
    return [];
  } else {
    const countArray = countup(n - 1);
    countArray.push(n);
    return countArray;
  }
}
console.log(countup(5));
The value [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] will be displayed in the console.

At first, this seems counterintuitive since the value of n decreases, but the values in the final array are increasing. This happens because the push happens last, after the recursive call has returned. At the point where n is pushed into the array, countup(n - 1) has already been evaluated and returned [1, 2, ..., n - 1].

We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n). The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter. If the function is called with a number less than 1, the function should return an empty array. For example, calling this function with n = 5 should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind. */

// Only change code below this line
function countdown(n){
  if (n < 1) {
    return [];
  } else {
    const countArray = countdown(n - 1);
    countArray.unshift(n);
    return countArray;
  }
}
console.log(countdown(5));
// Only change code above this line

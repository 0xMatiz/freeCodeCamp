/* Basic JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language you can use to make web pages interactive. It is one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS, and is supported by all modern browsers.
In this course, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. You'll start with basic data structures like numbers and strings. Then you'll learn to work with arrays, objects, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more. */

//Manipulate Arrays With unshift Method - 42% Complete

// Setup
const myArray = [["John", 23], ["dog", 3]];
myArray.shift();

// Only change code below this line
myArray.unshift(["Paul", 35]);



/* Shopping List - 42% Complete

Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.
The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.
["Chocolate Bar", 15]

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list. */
const myList = [];
myList.unshift(["Chocolate Bar", 15],["Cereal Bar", 10],["Yogurt Bar", 20],["White Chocolate Bar", 5],["Water Bottle", 40]);



/*Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions - 43% Complete

In JavaScript, we can divide up our code into reusable parts called functions.
Here's an example of a function:

function functionName() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}

1.You can call or invoke this function by using its name followed by parentheses, like this: functionName(); Each time the function is called it will print out the message Hello World on the dev console. All of the code between the curly braces will be executed every time the function is called.

2. Create a function called reusableFunction which prints the string Hi World to the dev console.
Call the function. */

function reusableFunction() {
    console.log("Hi World");
  }

  reusableFunction();



/* Passing Values to Functions with Arguments - 44% Complete

Parameters are variables that act as placeholders for the values that are to be input to a function when it is called. When a function is defined, it is typically defined along with one or more parameters. The actual values that are input (or "passed") into a function when it is called are known as arguments.
Here is a function with two parameters, param1 and param2:
function testFun(param1, param2) {
  console.log(param1, param2);
}
Then we can call testFun like this: testFun("Hello", "World");. We have passed two string arguments, Hello and World. Inside the function, param1 will equal the string Hello and param2 will equal the string World. Note that you could call testFun again with different arguments and the parameters would take on the value of the new arguments.
Create a function called functionWithArgs that accepts two arguments and outputs their sum to the dev console.
Call the function with two numbers as arguments. */
function functionWithArgs(argOne, argTwo) {
    console.log(argOne + argTwo);
  }
  
  functionWithArgs(1,2);
  functionWithArgs(7,9);



/* Return a Value from a Function with Return - 45% Complete

We can pass values into a function with arguments. You can use a return statement to send a value back out of a function.

Example

function plusThree(num) {
  return num + 3;
}

const answer = plusThree(5);
answer has the value 8.

plusThree takes an argument for num and returns a value equal to num + 3.

1. Create a function timesFive that accepts one argument, multiplies it by 5, and returns the new value.
*/
function timesFive (arg) {
    return arg * 5;
  }
  
  timesFive(5);
  timesFive(2);
  timesFive(0);



/* Global Scope and Functions - 46% Complete

In JavaScript, scope refers to the visibility of variables. Variables which are defined outside of a function block have Global scope. This means, they can be seen everywhere in your JavaScript code.

Variables which are declared without the let or const keywords are automatically created in the global scope. This can create unintended consequences elsewhere in your code or when running a function again. You should always declare your variables with let or const.

1. Using let or const, declare a global variable named myGlobal outside of any function. Initialize it with a value of 10.

2. Inside function fun1, assign 5 to oopsGlobal without using the var, let or const keywords. */
// Declare the myGlobal variable below this line
let myGlobal = 10;
oopsGlobal;

function fun1() {
  oopsGlobal = 5;// Assign 5 to oopsGlobal here
}

// Only change code above this line

function fun2() {
  let output = "";
  if (typeof myGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += "myGlobal: " + myGlobal;
  }
  if (typeof oopsGlobal != "undefined") {
    output += " oopsGlobal: " + oopsGlobal;
  }
  console.log(output);
}



/* Local Scope and Functions

Variables which are declared within a function, as well as the function parameters, have local scope. That means they are only visible within that function.

Here is a function myTest with a local variable called loc.

function myTest() {
  const loc = "foo";
  console.log(loc);
}

myTest();
console.log(loc);
The myTest() function call will display the string foo in the console. The console.log(loc) line (outside of the myTest function) will throw an error, as loc is not defined outside of the function.

The editor has two console.logs to help you see what is happening. Check the console as you code to see how it changes. Declare a local variable myVar inside myLocalScope and run the tests.

Note: The console will still display ReferenceError: myVar is not defined, but this will not cause the tests to fail. */
function myLocalScope() {
    // Only change code below this line
    let myVar;
    console.log('inside myLocalScope', myVar);
  }
  
  myLocalScope();
  // Run and check the console
  // myVar is not defined outside of myLocalScope
  console.log('outside myLocalScope', myVar);
